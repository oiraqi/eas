# Enterprise Cloud & Mobile Application Architecture, Design and Development
This course provides a solid background, both theoretical and practical, on the architecture, design and full stack development of cloud-based, web/mobile enterprise applications (EAs), based on well-defined security, performance, scalability, extensibility, portability, interoperability and maintainability requirements. Such an architecture, design and development are performed according to best practices and patterns, and using state of the art technology in order to promote developer productivity and reduce application lifecycle management costs and risks. Covered topics are organized in four parts, where each builds on previous ones:
- **Part I. The Principles, Requirement Areas and Architectural Models of EAs**
- **Part II. The (Monolithic) Server Side of EAs**
- **Part III. The Progressive Web/Mobile Client Side of EAs**
- **Part IV. Microservices and Cloud Frameworks and Platforms for EAs**

This course adopts and/or opens up opportunities for students to use the most popular technologies on the server side (Spring, Yahoo! Elide, Node, Google Firebase, Netflix OSS), client side (Angular, React, Vue, Svelt), and in between (REST, GraphQL, JSON:API). The course uses several real-life case studies, mainly the ones under XCommerce meta-project: https://github.com/oiraqi/xcommerce and this guided project on Coursera: https://www.coursera.org/projects/microservices-spring-cloud-java
