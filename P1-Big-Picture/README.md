## Introduction
In the context of this course, we will use the term Enterprise Applications (EAs) to mean Enterprise-class Applications, i.e., applications that exhibit enterprise-level features and characteristics. These features and characteristics can be captured/expressed as _complex non-functional requirements_ in terms of:
- How secure they are
- How fast they are
- How they can handle growing loads and numbers of users
- How they can evolve and offer a richer functionality through time
- How they can be accessible anytime, anywhere
- How they can integrate with other systems
- How they can be maintained
### Examples
- Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) software, such as Odoo (https://www.odoo.com)
- Hotel & Travel Management software, such as Booking (https://www.booking.com)
- Communication software, such as WhatsApp (https://www.whatsapp.com)
- Social Networking software, such as Facebook (http://www.facebook.com)
- E-commerce software, such as Amazon (https://www.amazon.com)

Notice that _NOT_ all these software apps and/or platforms are necessarily used by enterprises/professionals, e.g., WhatsApp, Facebook, Amazon, etc. However, all these examples have complex *enterprise-grade* requirements under the bullets mentioned above. These can be formally mapped to requirement areas detailed below.

## Common (Non-functional) Requirement Areas
- Security
- Performance
- Scalability
- Extensibility
- Ubiquitous Access
- Interoperability
- Maintainability

## Principles
- Principle 1: EAs should be aligned with the business – It’s not about technology; it’s about business
- Principle 2: EAs should be cost-effective
- Principle 3: EA requirements should be addressed through the whole software development lifecycle
- Principle 4: Don’t reinvent the wheel – Common business requirements mean common business solutions
- Principle 5: There is no best technology

## Architectural Models
### Client / Server (Two-Tier) Model
### Multi-tier SOA Model
### MVC
### Microservices
