## Introduction
In the context of this course, we will use the term Enterprise Applications (EAs) to mean Enterprise-class Applications, i.e., applications that exhibit enterprise-level features and characteristics. These features and characteristics can be captured/expressed as complex non-functional requirements under these areas:
- Performance
- Scalability
- Security
- Extensibility
- Portability
- Interoperability
- Maintainability
### Examples of EAs
- Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) software, such as Odoo (https://www.odoo.com)
- Hotel & Travel Management software, such as Booking (https://www.booking.com)
- Communication software, such as WhatsApp (https://www.whatsapp.com)
- Social Networking software, such as Facebook (http://www.facebook.com)
- E-commerce software, such as Amazon (https://www.amazon.com)

Notice that not all these software apps and/or platforms are necessarily used by enterprises/professionals, e.g., WhatsApp, Facebook, etc. However, all these examples have complex *enterprise-grade* requirements under the areas mentioned above.
